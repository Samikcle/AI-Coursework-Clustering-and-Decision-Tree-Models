# Description

Python implementation of an AI quiz involving data loading, clustering with KMeans, and classification with Decision Trees. The code covers:

• Reading and preprocessing CSV data with pandas

• Training and testing a KMeans clustering model (5 clusters)

• Assigning cluster labels (a–e) to the dataset

• Training a Decision Tree classifier to predict estimated performance from input features

• Saving final results to a CSV file

This project demonstrates practical applications of unsupervised (KMeans) and supervised (Decision Tree) machine learning methods.

## What I Learned

• Working with real data: I learned how to load and preprocess data using pandas, set custom headers, and handle file-related errors gracefully.

• Unsupervised learning with KMeans: I understood how clustering works, how to train a KMeans model, and how to interpret cluster assignments for grouping similar data points.

• Supervised learning with Decision Trees: I practiced training a decision tree classifier, controlling its depth to prevent overfitting, and using it to make predictions on new data.

• Integrating results back into the dataset: I discovered how to add new features (cluster results, decision tree outputs) to an existing dataset, which simulates real-world workflows where multiple models contribute insights.

• End-to-end pipeline building: From loading raw data to training models and saving results, I learned how to structure an end-to-end ML pipeline in Python.

This project helped me connect theoretical concepts from my AI course to practical implementation, reinforcing both my understanding of artificial intelligence and my ability to write clean, structured Python code.
